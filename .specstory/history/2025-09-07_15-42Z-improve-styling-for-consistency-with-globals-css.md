Improve the styling so its consistent with @globals.css  in @TimelineMarquee.tsx and related components

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering course adjustments**

I’m thinking about how mixed course categories might affect the badge display, particularly if it just shows the year with data classes. That feels somewhat arbitrary. I need to ensure the borders and backgrounds use the right color schemes I've noted before. It seems that work categories should not fall under data/history but remain neutral. I’ll also consider changing the header to use "section-title" for consistency, especially since there are so many class names for the timeline components. Small adjustments will help ensure everything aligns better.
**Updating header and components**

I think using "section-title" for the TechTicker headers makes sense, so I’ll update both instances. The YearTick component isn’t being used, so leaving it out could be fine. There are hover border colors on the SemesterCard that might need adjustment; I’m considering using a different hover color for categories. The work lane currently uses a light background that could be neutralized. I’ll implement these edits accordingly and check for related components, focusing on TimelineMarquee.tsx for now to ensure everything fits together well.</details></think>

I'll scan for related timeline components to ensure consistent use of theme classes, then update `src/components/TimelineMarquee.tsx` to align badge colors and headers with your global theme (e.g., Data -> lapiz, History -> copper, use `section-title`).

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Making adjustments**

I'm considering adjusting the YearTick by setting the vertical line's background border color and changing the year text classes to `.text-foreground opacity-80` instead of `text-accent-2`. 

For the Work lane bar, I think it might be good to use `bg-accent-2/15` and `text-accent-2`, but I'm unsure if that’s the best choice. 

Maybe I could apply `.year-badge` to add a badge on the SemesterCard? It could feel like overkill, so keeping it minimal is better. 

Lastly, I’m debating whether to improve the card classes with `.history-card` and `.data-card`, but I feel SemesterCard might be sufficient as it is. Time to implement these minor changes!</details></think>

I’m going to update the `CategoryBadge` to align Data with lapiz blue and History with copper as defined in your theme, switch year headers to use the `section-title` class, and neutralize year tick colors to use `border-color`/`foreground` for consistency with `globals.css`.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Checking for code lints**

I'm thinking we made some small edits, so it might be a good idea to check for any lints. The linter tool is optional, and the default setting says false, but the guidelines suggest I should run it after making edits. So, I'll go ahead and run `read_lints` for that file to ensure everything looks good. Just want to make sure everything's in order!</details></think>

I'll check for any linter issues from the recent edits before proceeding.

- Updated `CategoryBadge` to match global theme: Data uses lapiz (`accent`), History uses copper (`accent-2`).
- Switched year headers to use `section-title` for consistent typography and color handling across light/dark modes.
- Neutralized year tick styling to use `border-color` and `foreground` for better alignment with `globals.css`.

If you want the marquee work bars to also reflect theme variants (e.g., History vs Data spans), I can add variant-aware classes next.
