_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Investigating timeline issues**

I need to look into why the "Larger work stuff" in timeline.json isn’t appearing as its own lane. In the TimelineMarquee, they've created work lane bars that span multiple semesters. The code calculates spans based on semester entries where semester.work is available and creates a lane at the top. The work lane's height is set at 8 and uses `measured.totalWidth`. I’ll also check how `offsetLeft` relates to the nearest offset parent in the scrolling Marquee.
**Reviewing work lane implementation**

I've noticed that they set the class for the outer container to `relative overflow-hidden w-screen left-1/2 right-1/2 -ml-[50vw] -mr-[50vw]` inside the Marquee. The Marquee duplicates child content to create the scroll effect. The work bars, likely referring to long work spans like Allos AI across spring and summer 2024, should appear correctly. The code merges identical work titles and organizations across consecutive semesters to compute spans, covering entries for Document Remediation Specialists in 2023, which seems to be implemented well.
**Diagnosing lane visibility issues**

I'm wondering why the work items aren't showing as their own lane. It could be that `measured.totalWidth` is initially 0 because the computation might be running before the nodes are available. They have set a ResizeObserver on `laneRef.current`, computing at mount, but the Marquee may be cloning or hiding children, causing measurement issues. The absolute container has a width based on `measured.totalWidth`, which depends on the left and right offsets. Since the semester cards wrapper has no left margin, the offsets may be zero, affecting the calculations.
**Evaluating width and z-index issues**

I’m considering that the width of the relative wrapper might not equal `measured.totalWidth`. Could there be an overflow problem causing cropping? The Marquee uses `overflow-hidden`, which seems okay. The z-index layering could be a potential issue since both the work lane container and the semester cards row have a `z-10` class, meaning they could overlap. The work lane is supposed to be above the baseline. It might not show up if `measured.totalWidth` is still zero because the computation hasn’t updated yet. They have a useEffect with dependencies, but `laneRef.current` nodes may not be available immediately after the render.
**Analyzing visibility of work lane**

I’m considering why the "Larger work stuff" isn’t showing as its own lane. The measurement might not account for the cloned children in the Marquee, which could lead to conflicts with offsets. Also, if `measured.totalWidth` is initially zero, the absolute lane won’t position correctly. The z-index conflicts could hide it behind the semester cards, and the transparency of the background colors may make it invisible against certain backgrounds. 

The computation for spans seems valid, but they might not be updating when the effect runs. These visibility issues might stem from how the Marquee handles transformations and duplicates the content. Lastly, perhaps they expect a static overlay, but the scrolling transforms complicate things.
**Checking visibility of lane bars**

They mentioned that the "Larger work stuff" doesn't show up as its own lane, which likely means they don’t see any bars at all. I can't run the code to test it directly, but I can check the CSS variable definitions. I’ll look into `src/app/globals.css` to make sure that the accent color `accent-2/15` is set to a visible color. That might help clarify why the bars aren't appearing as expected. Let’s dive in!</details></think>

---

I'll quickly scan `globals.css` and related components to confirm color variables and z-index don't hide the work lane, and then check `TimelineMarquee.tsx` logic for span calculation and measurement to find why bars might not render.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Troubleshooting Tailwind colors**

It seems there might be an issue with the custom color class '/15' not being recognized by Tailwind. If 'bg-accent-2/15' fails, then the background might turn transparent, although the border color class 'border-accent-2/40' could have the same problem. Despite this, the element should still exist even if it's invisible. The text class "text-[11px] text-accent-2" is defined in CSS, ensuring visibility. If text isn't showing, it could mean the container's width is zero or there's an issue with the computed width calculations.
**Analyzing marquee container issues**

I’m considering that the marquee content's container might not be wide enough due to the relative positioning. The laneRef's flex row could affect its width. The absolutely-positioned bars have their width set to measured.totalWidth, which might be 0 during the initial render. After the effect runs and state updates, it should display correctly. However, since the marquee clones and moves, laneRef offsets could be misaligned. The top section might be covered by a gradient overlay, but it seems that they've removed that gradient.
**Evaluating z-index and overflow**

I'm thinking about how z-index layering works here. The semester cards row has a z-index of 10, while the lines baseline sits at z-index 0. The work lane also has a z-index of 10. Since the absolute container has its position set to left 0, top 0, the cards row container with a relative z-index of 10 can overlap but shouldn't because of padding at the top. Then, there's the overflow hidden set on a section that might affect how the bars are displayed, especially since the wrapper is within a marquee that duplicates.
**Examining wrapper width issues**

I'm realizing the wrapper's width isn't explicitly set; it only has padding at the top. So, absolute children's left and right coordinates may end up computed based on that unspecified width. They've set the bar container's width to measured.totalWidth, but the top-level wrapper’s width isn't defined. This means buttons in the work lane could overflow. The cards row, being in a flex container, takes natural width, but since the work lane has an absolute position, it doesn’t affect the wrapper’s width. Ultimately, the wrapper's width equals that of the flex row.
**Analyzing visibility issues with bars container**

I'm trying to figure out why the absolute bars container is not visible. It uses measured.totalWidth, but that doesn't necessarily match the wrapper's width. The issue might arise from how laneRef interacts with duplicate children created by Marquee. If laneRef only selects the original and not its clones, visibility could be affected. Additionally, the transform applied to the Marquee component might influence the position of the Work lane. There's also a concern about the spans computed by the system. I should check the timeline data import to ensure everything aligns properly.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing Marquee behavior**

I'm considering how the laneRef works inside a flex container within the Marquee component. The Marquee clones its content and uses transform for scrolling, but I think the width of the "relative" container might only be as wide as its children. I need to set the parent's width to the total width measured to inform the Marquee. It seems the absolute lane is set to a height of 0 except for 8 px, which might complicate things. The Marquee expects a single inline content, and I'm unsure how that will work with the flex row setup.
**Investigating timeline issues**

The question highlights that "larger work stuff in timeline.json does not show up as its own lane," which means the "work lane" bars aren't displaying correctly. I'm examining the code that enables this lane to see how it computes and merges consecutive identical work entries. For instance, "Document Remediation Specialist" entries from fall 2022 to fall 2023 form one span. Then, the "Machine Learning Associate" for spring and summer 2024 counts as another span. It seems like there's an inconsistency with the "Advanced Coder" entries across 2024 fall and 2025 spring, which might need investigation due to their non-adjacency.
**Confirming sequence logic**

I see that the semesterEntries are sorted correctly by year, with spring, summer, and fall in order. For 2024, fall is the last entry, and then 2025 spring follows, making them adjacent. Both entries for "Advanced Coder" from 'Outlier AI' can merge into one span. The subsequent 'Student Fellow' spans for 2025 summer and fall also merge. However, they're not visible, so I need to check the CSS classes applied to the work lane bars. The position should be absolute within the container, but if `measured.totalWidth` is zero at the first render, that would prevent visibility.
**Evaluating visibility issues**

Before the `measured` width is set, it defaults to 0, causing the absolute bar container to also have a width of 0, which means nothing is displayed. After the effect runs and updates the measured width, React should re-render with the new width and span rectangles. However, I’m uncertain if Marquee’s content duplication will affect the `offsetLeft` measurement because the DOM is in motion. Also, both the absolute container and the semester row are set to z-10, which may cause them to overlap, while baseline and year ticks sit at z-0.
**Unpacking the layout concerns**

So, I have both the bars and the cards row at z-10. With that configuration, if they overlap, it’s tricky because later elements in the DOM appear above earlier ones. The bars are early in the DOM, but the cards row comes later, which could cause it to cover the bars since they share the same z-index. The calculations for padding and width suggest the bars should fit within their designated space. However, it's also confusing because the widths only account for cards, not the YearSeparators, which means the bars may not display as expected. Also, there's an issue with the absolute container's width if it's not getting measured properly, perhaps due to the ResizeObserver not firing as intended. Overall, it raises questions about whether the lane is completely invisible or just misaligned.
**Investigating Marquee setup**

The user mentions '@timeline.json', and I'm thinking that the issue might stem from the variant of the Marquee being used on the app page. The default prop for TimelineMarquee is set to 'marquee', but the page might be using 'collapsible' instead. When the user says "Larger work stuff does not show up as its own lane," it suggests there may be issues with visibility when using the 'marquee' variant. I should check page.tsx to understand how TimelineMarquee is being implemented.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Investigating timeline display**

I need to dig into why the "Larger work stuff" from timeline.json isn't appearing as its own lane in TimelineMarquee.tsx. The component has a "work lane" designed to create spans based on consecutive semester entries with matching work titles and organizations. The timelineData import is pointing to a TypeScript module, not the JSON file, which could be the issue. I see both 'src/timeline.ts' and 'src/timeline.json', but the component isn't utilizing the JSON file. Let's figure this out!
**Clarifying container measurements**

Alright, so the width of the 'work lane' container comes from the computed totalWidth, which is determined by rights[-1] - lefts[0]. The bars are absolutely positioned with their left set to lefts[s.start] and their width calculated as rights[s.end] - lefts[s.start]. The absolute container sits within a relatively positioned wrapper inside the marquee content. This setup aligns left coordinates to the container's edge, which should be 0 at lefts[0]. I also see the Semester cards using flex properties and laneRef, while the Year tick and baseline are based on totalWidth measurements. Let’s ensure this works!
**Examining node positioning**

I’m looking at the nodes selected from laneRef using querySelectorAll. The offsetLeft is computed based on their offsetParent, which is the closest positioned ancestor that isn’t static. I’m curious if the "div data-sem-idx" elements are statically positioned inside the flex container, meaning laneRef could be the offsetParent. The flex container may default to static, but offsetLeft would still apply relative to that ancestor. However, the "Work lane" absolute container sits in a different container than laneRef, both being children of a "relative" wrapper. Let's clarify this positioning!
**Understanding left measurements**

Okay, so the left measurements I’m taking are relative to the laneRef container, not necessarily to the wrapper's edge. The offsetLeft values for those nodes relate to their offsetParent, which could be laneRef if it's positioned, and since it's set as "relative," that's confirmed. However, the "Work lane" absolute container is anchored to the wrapper’s left, not laneRef. The laneRef might have a left offset inside the wrapper due to padding. It seems both laneRef and "Year tick markers" could be aligned at left: 0, but I need to clarify this further!
**Investigating the "Work lane" display**

I need to figure out why the "Work lane" isn't visible. It seems the measured.totalWidth relies on the right and left offsets, which might be less than the full width needed. The absolute container isn't within laneRef, but its widths are still relative to it. There’s potential for overlapping or clipping with the Marquee component using overflow-hidden. Also, if the computed width is 0 initially, that might explain the issue. I see spans should be formed from Document Remediation and others, but if they are missing, perhaps there's a rendering or color visibility problem to address. Let's work through this!
**Analyzing the "Work lane" visibility issue**

I’m trying to figure out why the "Larger work stuff" isn’t showing in its lane. The width is calculated from the rightmost and leftmost offsets, but if those are 0 because of the nodes not being selected correctly, that might be the cause. The Marquee component also wraps these nodes, which could lead to width being reported as 0 initially due to cloning. It's possible that the nodes are measured incorrectly if the compute function runs before they exist. Using `useLayoutEffect` instead of `useEffect` might help track these dimensions more reliably. Let's dig deeper!
**Investigating visibility issues with the "Work lane"**

I need to figure out why the "Work lane" isn't appearing. The z-index layering seems fine, but the transparent background might make it invisible if the accent color isn't correctly mapped in Tailwind. Although the text should still show, indicating the lane exists. The Marquee component can affect visibility, as it clones children but may not account for height properly. I suspect the width measurement could be zero if the Marquee hasn't rendered the child nodes yet. I’ll summarize these points for clarity and suggest using `useLayoutEffect` after mounting to ensure accurate width computation.
**Investigating the missing "spans" array**

The user mentioned that some elements aren't showing, which leads me to think that the 'spans' array might be empty. This could happen if all 'entry.semester.work' values are undefined or if the 'semesterEntries' array is empty. I've checked that 'semesterEntries' is built correctly, but there might be an issue with file imports or the way the component initializes. The 'Marquee' component seems to create visibility problems since it doesn't account for heights properly. I should suggest measuring widths after the DOM mounts and ensure that related calculations use the correct reference points for layout adjustments.</details></think>

---

I'll update the measurement logic in the timeline component to compute positions using bounding client rects relative to the lane container and use the lane's scrollWidth for reliable width, which should make the work lane bars render correctly inside the marquee.

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating marquee behavior**

I'm looking into how the `Marquee` from react-fast-marquee works, specifically noting that it uses transform to scroll content. The work lane needs to be inside the marquee to scroll properly, which it is. However, both the work lane and semester cards lane have a z-index of -10, while the baseline line is at z-index 0, which should be lower. I also need to ensure the wrapper has the correct padding for the work lane. The classNames on work bars might be too faint on a muted background, but still visible!
**Clarifying measurement calculations**

I'm diving into the compute measurement by setting the totalWidth to the difference between rights[last] and lefts[0]. The width of the absolute work lane container is then determined by measured.totalWidth in pixels. However, the cards row might have a left margin due to the wrapper structure, meaning the first card's left might not be exactly 0. Earlier code used offsetLeft, which needs to relate to the laneRef element as the offsetParent, since our node is a child within it. This should work out too!
**Addressing marquee issues**

I've noticed there could be a problem with using Marquee, as it clones nodes and applies CSS transforms. This means that offsetLeft may not accurately reflect the transform, so using getBoundingClientRect relative to laneRect is likely more reliable. There's also a core issue from the user mention about changes in timeline.json not reflecting. The component isn't importing timeline.json, which is the primary cause. We really need to unify the data sources and suggest switching the import to '../timeline.json.' I'll check the tsconfig.json to see if `resolveJsonModule` is set to true.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing course span issues**

I'm considering whether "Machine Learning Associate" doesn't connect across semesters because of how the `key` function combines title and organization. It looks like 2023 had Document Remediation across several terms, potentially crossing from 2022 fall to 2023 fall. However, there seems to be a gap during 2023 fall where courses are present but the work isn't fully aligned. Additionally, I’m also questioning whether the bars might be clipped due to the `overflow-hidden` setting on the marquee container. There might be a width issue with the relative wrapper too.
**Examining width measurements**

I see that the width of the lane is set to `measured.totalWidth`, but the relative wrapper doesn't seem to be constrained. The cloned marquee needs its children's widths to be considered. I’m calculating the total width from `rights[last] - lefts[0]`, which only factors in the widths of the last and first cards. However, there are gaps from elements like `YearSeparator` in between those cards, which aren't counted in the measurement. The spans need to align with the semester cards, excluding separators, but the absolute container width should account for everything, including the separators. Wait, are those separators actually positioned within the list?
**Investigating lane visibility issues**

I’m noticing that separators occupy width, but if I only computed `totalWidth` from card lefts and rights, the rightmost coordinate might just be a rough estimate of the last card's width. I wonder if those separators are affecting visibility. It seems the work bars lane isn't appearing at all, which could be due to `z-index`. The `Marquee` uses transforms that might cause the overlay to stack behind other elements. Even though the `work lane` is absolutely positioned, it might not be enough to prevent overlaps with other background elements.
**Clarifying data import issues**

It seems the outer wrapper has a padding that positions the baseline at 56, while the work lane sits at top 0. The marquee container's height is defined by `py-6`, and the `relative` outer wrapper should adequately encompass both elements. 

A key possibility is that the `spanRects` state relies on reading positions but only updates if there are nodes present. The real issue might be the import of `timelineData` from the TypeScript file instead of the updated JSON file, which the user edited recently. This could be causing discrepancies with data like the "Student Fellow" for 2025.
**Investigating the timeline issues**

If the user modified the JSON, the changes might not show because their component imports from `timeline.ts`, not the updated JSON. They pointed out that the "Larger work stuff" in the JSON doesn't appear as its own lane, possibly due to separated entries for summer, fall, and spring positions affecting spans. 

My fix updates measurement methods to use bounding rectangles, ensuring proper rendering of work bars within the marquee. We should clarify if they want to continue using JSON updates and ensure our adjustments are clear, checking if any visibility issues remain.
**Finalizing code citations**

I need to make sure we include citations for the code lines using METHOD 1 when quoting existing code. We can keep it concise, so a small snippet showing the import line `import timelineData from '../timeline';` might be helpful. I’ll use the file path and line numbers as specified. Additionally, I'll mention the changes we made to the measurement logic, citing the small block around lines 369-383, although quoting this changed code is optional. I want to keep summaries short and clear.</details></think>

---

- I see two likely causes:
  - Data source mismatch: `TimelineMarquee` imports the TypeScript module, not the JSON. So edits to `src/timeline.json` won’t affect the component.
```7:8:src/components/TimelineMarquee.tsx
import timelineData from '../timeline';
```
  - Measurement bug inside the marquee: absolute positioning + the marquee’s transform meant `offsetLeft`/`offsetWidth` produced unreliable widths, so the work-lane bars could be measured as width 0 and not render.

What I changed
- Switched measurement to use bounding client rects relative to the lane container and fall back to the lane’s `scrollWidth` for reliable total width. This lets the “work” bars render as their own lane above the semester cards, even inside the moving marquee.

Verification
- Reload the page and hover the marquee: you should now see copper-tinted bars (work lane) spanning consecutive semesters with the same `title`+`organization` (e.g., 2024 spring→summer Allos AI, 2025 summer→fall CEC).

Question
- Do you want the component to read from `src/timeline.json` instead of `src/timeline.ts`? If yes, I’ll switch the import and keep types.

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Responding to user inquiry**

It looks like I need to address an empty user query regarding the lane issue they previously mentioned. We’ve already made some adjustments, like converting the offset to the bounding client rect and noting the data source mismatch. Although the user hasn't asked anything new, it seems they might want to confirm that JSON is being used correctly. Our task is not to provide updates unless using tools, and since no new question has come, I’ll wait for their response.
**Considering JSON import change**

It seems we should switch to JSON if that's what the user wants. They mentioned investigating why the larger work in `@timeline.json` isn't appearing as its own lane, suggesting they expected changes after editing this file. The cause seems to be that we were importing a TypeScript file instead. We can update the import to JSON with `assert { type: 'json' }`, but since `tsconfig` allows resolving JSON modules, I can simply change the import line to read from `timeline.json`. That way, it matches the existing interfaces.
**Assessing marquee setup and imports**

We need to ensure that the configuration allows for JSON imports since `tsconfig` has `resolveJsonModule` set to true. With Next 14 using the App Router, it should compile correctly. Also, the marquee should measure after the DOM is ready, which is already happening inside `useEffect`. 

It’s important to remember that the Marquee library clones elements, and we should manage the width of these clones to fit the total measured width. We’ve updated the measurement to use `getBoundingClientRect`, and we should proceed with the import switch now.
**Updating imports and confirming data**

I need to call `apply_patch` to edit the import statement in `TimelineMarquee.tsx`. I've confirmed that the JSON file has the same data—great! I’ll modify line 7 to switch the import from the TS module to JSON. After that, I can provide a brief summary message about fixing the root cause and the measurement fix. I also need to be sure to include a status update before using any tools, keeping everything concise and maintaining indentation. Finally, I might run lints afterward as optional, based on the previous instruction.
**Implementing import change and measuring tweaks**

The previous read_lints suggested running it on recently edited files, but since the "linter_errors" parameter is set to false, it's not mandatory. Since the recommendations note we could skip this for brevity, I’ll go ahead and implement the import change. Additionally, I should make sure that the `Marquee` children properly measure the width using `laneRef`, which is set to the row container. We previously used a ref for 'flex items-stretch,' so that’s good. Now, let's proceed with the patch!</details></think>

---

I'll switch the timeline data import in the component from the TypeScript module to the JSON file so edits to `src/timeline.json` are reflected, then finish up.

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Identifying potential issues**

I’m noticing that the laneRef is within the cloned child, which means each clone gets its own measurements. The absolute work lane should match the measured width. However, since Marquee clones the container, the left position is set to 0 relative to each clone's container. I'm considering if there’s a bug due to marquee transformations running before the DOM nodes are laid out, even though we call it after mounting. The user's complaint about larger items not displaying properly seems linked to using the wrong TS module. We might need to clarify and seek confirmation.
**Summarizing the update**

I need to provide a status update without using any tools. The instructions suggest keeping it concise, focusing only on relevant code. While the user appreciates clarifying questions during planning stages, we're currently in the coding phase, so I'll be brief. I should mention we switched the import to JSON to reconcile differences and let them know we didn't run lints, as they’re optional. Still, running read_lints could be beneficial since it checks for errors, even though it's set to false by default.
**Clarifying tool usage requirements**

I need to ensure I provide a micro-update at the top before making any tool calls, as per developer instructions. We've previously used tools effectively with updates included. For this turn, since we applied a patch twice, I need to follow up with a brief status update. In the last response, I mentioned switching things, so I’ll recap that with bullet points for clarity. I might also show a small code citation for the import line, but it’s not mandatory. I think a tiny code fence could help illustrate the changes.
**Assessing the TimelineMarquee usage**

I noticed that the earlier message included a code block in method 1 style, which aligns with the citing code spec. However, I’ll keep things minimal. It's important to note that `src/app/page.tsx` uses TechTicker but doesn’t render TimelineMarquee, so I need to see if TimelineMarquee is referenced elsewhere. If not, the user might miss seeing the results. We’ve updated the logic, so here’s my final summary:

- Micro-update: "I changed the measurement in TimelineMarquee to use timeline.json; the work lane should render now."

- Quick question: "Do you want JSON as the source, or should we revert?"</details></think>

---

I fixed two issues so the work lane renders:

- Switched the data source to `src/timeline.json` so your JSON edits actually drive the component.
```1:1:src/components/TimelineMarquee.tsx
import timelineData from '../timeline.json';
```
- Corrected lane measurements to use bounding rects relative to the lane container (and fall back to `scrollWidth`). This prevents zero-width work bars inside the marquee.
```368:384:src/components/TimelineMarquee.tsx
const laneRect = lane.getBoundingClientRect();
nodes.forEach((el) => {
  const rect = el.getBoundingClientRect();
  const left = rect.left - laneRect.left;
  const right = rect.right - laneRect.left;
  lefts.push(left);
  rights.push(right);
});
const measuredWidth = rights[rights.length - 1] - lefts[0];
const totalWidth = Math.max(Math.ceil(measuredWidth), lane.scrollWidth);
setMeasured({ lefts, rights, totalWidth });
```

- Please refresh and check the marquee: you should now see copper-tinted work bars spanning consecutive semesters (e.g., Allos AI 2024 Spring→Summer, CEC 2025 Summer→Fall).

Do you want to keep `timeline.json` as the single source of truth, or switch back to the TS module?

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing laneRef and Marquee behavior**

I'm considering how laneRef acts as a container for the cards while being inside a Marquee that clones content and shifts it. This might lead to position mismatches because the Marquee can create an inner container with its own transformation properties. 

On the other hand, I'm also reflecting on the span lengths possibly being zero due to how spans are computed from consecutive work segments in semesterEntries. Since there are contiguous indexes from spring through fall for a particular work title, that looks good.
**Evaluating work spans across semesters**

I'm looking at the spans for the roles in 2024 and 2025. The Machine Learning Associate role in spring and summer 2024 is contiguous, but the fall 2024 position as Advanced Coder Outlier starts a new span. 

For 2025, both summer and fall have the Student Fellow CEC role contiguous. The Advanced Coder Outlier from fall 2024 and spring 2025 should merge because they share the same title, creating a coherent span across year boundaries. But they might not render correctly due to CSS issues with layering or height.
**Examining z-index for layers**

I'm thinking about how the absolute top is positioned relative to its container. The semester cards row has a class of "flex items-stretch gap-6 relative z-10," and both the work lane and the semester row share a z-index of 10. This means the layering order is determined by their DOM sequence. Since the cards row comes after the work lane, it could potentially overlap and obscure the work bars, which need to be displayed properly above or below depending on the design intention.
**Assessing the visibility of bars and cards**

I'm analyzing the setup where the bars should be above the cards. The bars start at top 0, with the baseline positioned at 56, and then the cards row comes beneath that. There's some padding to consider, and I calculate the heights: WORK_LANE_HEIGHT is 32, and there's a gap below of 24. However, if the parent container has an overflow hidden, it might be cropping the bars. The marquee does use a transform to move elements, but since the work lane is within the same relative container as the cards, it should scroll properly. So, why aren’t they visible?</details></think>

_**User (2025-09-07 15:27Z)**_

Just re-impliment it to ensure it pops up

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing layout positioning**

I'm considering the layout of the work bars and how they're positioned. The bars are absolutely positioned within a relatively sized container. The Marquee content uses a trick with left: 1/2 and full-width overflow, which might lead to overflow clipping or z-index issues. The Marquee has an overflow-hidden container that wraps around it. I'm also realizing that the width may initially be zero until measurement runs, impacting the visibility of the bars. Another detail: we updated the import path for timeline.json, which is now correctly located.
**Optimizing Marquee component**

I'm looking into how Next.js imports JSON, which will work since resolveJsonModule is true and supported. I need to fix the Marquee component so it doesn’t incorrectly mount on the server, ensuring it's a client component. To improve visibility, I could add a debug placeholder bar when the measured width is zero. It might be simpler to redraw the "work lane" using fixed widths instead of measuring. Alternatively, I could set the style width to 'max-content' or use laneRef.current.scrollWidth on the initial render. The width initially shows zero until after the effect runs.
**Troubleshooting Marquee visibility**

I'm examining how the Marquee clones child content and uses transforms. The getBoundingClientRect values may be relative to the viewport, which is useful for calculating positions. I'm considering if laneRect might vary between clones, but we're referencing laneRef from the original, which should be fine. It's confirmed that the TechTicker "marquee" variant is included. Yet, the user can't see the bars, possibly due to z-index issues or a gradient overlay. The bar's opacity might be too low, so I might increase its opacity, height, and add a background overlay.
**Addressing Marquee layout issues**

I'm noticing a potential issue with the Marquee wrapping its children, which might be causing problems with width calculations. The absolute container width is set to measured.totalWidth but may not be wide enough since the parent container is dynamic. The Marquee clones content horizontally, but the overlay needs to match the total content width to display correctly. The user wants to simplify this: I could rewrite it to create a dedicated bar lane above the semester cards that doesn’t rely on measuring.
**Enhancing the work lane visibility**

I’m looking at the z-index values to ensure the layout works properly. The year ticks are set to z-0, while the cards and work lane are at z-10, so there shouldn't be any overlaps. The user's request suggests making the work lane more robust by eliminating the need for measurement and instead anchoring an overlay to each semester card. I can create small 'work' segments above each card instead of a single continuous bar. 

If 'semester.work' exists, I’ll draw a small chip above each card, along with a fallback option to render these chips based on the lefts and rights arrays. We can also bump the z-index to 20 for better visibility while keeping code changes minimal. Let’s implement these adjustments.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I'm working through some design details. The baseline is set at z-0, with year ticks at z-0 as well, and semester cards are at z-10. I've set the work lane to z-20, which seems good. However, it might be masked by an overflow-hidden wrapper around the marquee. The work lane’s position is at the top plus the baseline top. The wrapper is a relative container with only padding on top, while the work lane has an absolute top of 0 inside it. Good!
I'm facing a styling issue with the width. I noticed that the immediate container within the Marquee might not be wide enough. The Marquee clones are displayed as inline-block, while the laneRef container's width is the sum of its cards. I set the style width on an absolute overlay, but it needs to be within a parent with the same width. This parent is a relative wrapper that lacks a specified width. It’s all about ensuring the overlay has enough space! But it could be under the cards in the DOM—z-index to the rescue!
Okay, I realize there's a key point here: the spans I computed earlier depend on the semester entries. The issue is that we calculate spans before the measurement effect, and they only push when there are consecutive identical work items. Looking into the data, I see there are indeed consecutive identical work items: three instances of Document Remediation across the 2023 terms and two consecutive entries for Machine Learning Associate in 2024. However, there's a break between 2022 fall and 2023 spring, but they are consecutive in the entries list! The span should actually start from 2022 fall and continue through to 2023 fall.
I'm pondering if the approach we're taking is the right one. The spans array should contain various entries, and the spanRects use the lefts and rights from the start and end indices. But if the measured arrays are empty when we compute, we might encounter problems. While the nodes from the semester cards do exist, I’m concerned about running the compute function before the first paint. It needs to happen after the DOM is inserted. There’s also the issue with Marquee where content moves into a clone, possibly leading to negative values in getBoundingClientRect due to transforms. But hopefully, adjusting with laneRect should keep it fine!
I'm dealing with several issues regarding the Marquee setup. The wrapper is set to measured.totalWidth, but I have to ensure components are correctly displayed, especially with the overflow hidden property. The background and border might not apply due to CSS variable mappings, which require 'accent-2' to be declared. It also seems like the overlay width matches measured.totalWidth, but if Marquee clones content, the overlay could be hiding behind other elements. 

I need a check if nodes are available when computing rects; they might not exist at the first mount. To ensure visibility, I might add a debug indicator to confirm that components are present, along with adjusting z-index and setting pointer events accordingly.
I've got a few things to check regarding the Marquee setup. First, I need to ensure 'pauseOnHover' is set to true to stop scrolling when hovered. If the bars are still not visible, it may be because measured.lefts and rights are empty, making measured.totalWidth 0. Although the overlay should update once the effect triggers, it’s tricky since Marquee clones content, which might mean the laneRef only references a clone.

To verify visibility, I could temporarily add a 'Work Lane Active' placeholder for debugging and check if the overlay has enough height. If necessary, I can increase the work lane height and adjust its background for visibility. Lastly, I'll provide the user with instructions to refresh their view and ensure there's content in the current display.
I've added a fallback so that you can still see per-semester bars even if merging isn't working. If you don't see them, I can add a static debug bar at the top temporarily. However, I want to confirm if you're okay with keeping the fallback. I re-implemented the work lane to ensure visibility and improved the measurement and fallback logic.

Here's the summary: 

- The `TimelineMarquee` is rendered via `TechTicker` on the home page.
- I've enhanced the work lane with more robust measurements and increased contrast.
- Please perform a hard refresh, as the bars should scroll into view after a few seconds. 

Let me know if you need any further adjustments!</details></think>

---

- Yes, it’s being rendered. `Home` uses `TechTicker variant="marquee"`, and `TechTicker` renders `TimelineMarquee`.

What I changed to force it to show
- Switched to `src/timeline.json` so your JSON edits drive the UI.
- Rewrote measurement to use bounding rects + `scrollWidth` so widths aren’t 0 inside a marquee.
- Increased z-index and contrast of the work bars.
- Added a fallback: if merged spans aren’t computed, it now draws per‑semester work bars so something always appears.

How to verify quickly
- Hard refresh the page. Let the marquee scroll a moment; you should see copper bars with labels (e.g., “Machine Learning Associate • Allos AI”) above the cards.
- If you still don’t, try briefly hovering to pause and look near 2024–2025 where the work entries exist.

If you want, I can temporarily add a static “WORK LANE” debug stripe so it’s unmistakable, then remove it after you confirm.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering width computation**

I’m exploring the idea of computing widths by using `offsetLeft` and `offsetWidth` relative to `laneRef`, instead of using rectangles. We've switched to rectangles because of transforms. Another option is using `ResizeObserver` on child nodes, but we already have it observing the `laneRef` element. It only triggers on size changes to the lane, not the position of children, which may initially return zero values if `laneRef` isn't in the DOM. It's crucial that the compute function runs after nodes are rendered.
**Analyzing Marquee behavior**

I’m considering how the Marquee clones children and uses a translate transform, but since `laneRef` is inside the Marquee child container, it might be pointing to the first clone. There's a chance the nodes aren’t mounted initially when our compute function runs. Marquee animates content with CSS, and if the compute runs before `offsetLeft` updates, it could lead to issues. The observed behavior indicates the `ResizeObserver` callback triggers a recompute, but the initial measured state could default to zero, rendering the lanes and bars invisible. We should also recompute after all fonts load.
**Exploring fixes for computation**

I’m considering a few potential fixes for ensuring our compute function works as intended. One idea is to add a `setTimeout` to compute after 100ms or use a `MutationObserver` or `requestAnimationFrame` loop until the nodes are found. I could also track Marquee's `onInit` or `onFinish`, but checking the docs shows it might not be necessary. 

To strengthen scheduling, I’ll wrap compute in `requestAnimationFrame` to ensure it runs after layout. I'll switch to `useLayoutEffect` for the first compute to read the layout after the DOM is painted, which should work well in a 'use client' environment in Next.js. Finally, adding an interval on mount could help recompute until the lefts and widths are populated.
**Planning adjustments for computation**

I must be careful to avoid infinite loops in my logic. Currently, I'm already observing `laneRef` using `ResizeObserver`, but the children's positions might not change size. 

Another thing to consider is that the Marquee clones children, which can cause transformations in the `laneRef`'s parent. This means that while `getBoundingClientRect` might give variable results, the relative difference between `rect.right` and `left` should remain stable. 

To enhance the setup, I'll use `useLayoutEffect` with `requestAnimationFrame` to compute dimensions after mount and again after 100ms. Adding a `MutationObserver` will help track changes in the children list. I’ll also implement a fallback for `measured.totalWidth`, summing the widths plus a total gap of 6 pixels, while still keeping the `scrollWidth` fallback. Lastly, I need to ensure that the effect dependencies consider the `semesterEntries.map` join, including their count, and confirm that the measured values are used for styling width.
**Modifying measurement logic**

I’m planning to simplify the measurement effect for better performance. First, I'll replace the `useEffect` block with a stable `scheduleCompute` function that batches reads after `requestAnimationFrame` (rAF).

Then, I’ll use `useLayoutEffect` to run an immediate compute after mount, making sure to update the import line to include `useLayoutEffect` from React. This means adjusting line 3 to “import React, { useEffect, useMemo, useRef, useState, useLayoutEffect }.” 

I'll create a helper function called `compute()` within the effect, scheduling its execution to ensure accurate measurements. Additionally, I’ll add `MutationObserver` for observing child list changes and keep the existing `ResizeObserver` setup. I must ensure correct indentation and context while crafting these patches. Lastly, I need to decide on removing the user's earlier `console.log(spanRects)` or keeping it as needed.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Refactoring components for hooks**

I'm thinking we need to move hooks to the top level or create separate components for the MarqueeVariant. The parent can then choose which one to render. This should resolve the linter issues and possibly improve compute ordering. Also, I noticed the YearTick is unused, which we can either ignore or remove. We have a console.log present that needs to be taken out. We should adjust the top offset as needed. Overall, it’s a refactor of `TimelineMarquee` into two separate components while managing the Marquee duplication carefully.
**Optimizing Marquee component**

I need to clarify that laneRef acts as the flex container for semester cards and utilizes getBoundingClientRect for measurement. The Marquee component wraps and clones content, but measuring in moving transform coordinates can be avoided by initially using offsetLeft. Although previous issues with offsetLeft exist, getBoundingClientRect seems reliable even with transforms applied. The main concern is timing; I'll run the compute function after the initial layout and when Marquee has inserted clones. I’m planning to create the `MarqueeTimeline` component in the same file to handle props like yearsSorted and compute semesterEntries efficiently.
**Implementing compute for TimelineMarquee**

I'm planning to move the code inside the block and keep the 'collapsible' variant in the parent `TimelineMarquee`. If that's not used, I’ll render `<MarqueeTimeline yearsSorted={yearsSorted}/>`. 

To address the linter issues, I'll remove the hook usage from the top level and add a robust compute function. This should be called after the first render using requestAnimationFrame and also when document fonts are ready. I’ll implement several setTimeouts for ensure compute is called effectively. Additionally, I'll introduce a MutationObserver to handle changes in the laneRef children, likely related to marquee clones.
**Addressing code issues**

I'm feeling a bit unclear about certain aspects, but it seems like using MutationObserver is acceptable. I want to keep the code minimal, especially since we spotted compile errors in page.tsx due to unescaped apostrophes. While these aren’t directly related to the timeline bars, they might cause build failures that could block progress. The user wants to make sure everything works smoothly, so I’ll fix the hooks conditional error for now. I also need to apply adjustments to the file and reorganize the components.</details></think>

---

I'll refactor the timeline component to remove conditional hook usage by splitting the marquee logic into its own child component, and add robust initial measurement scheduling (requestAnimationFrame + setTimeout + fonts.ready) so the work bars render without requiring a manual resize. Then I'll remove the debug console.log.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Addressing viewport issues**

I need to respond clearly because the user noted that measurements only show up when the viewport changes. This suggests that measurement computation is triggered during a resize, not on initial render. We might consider implementing a better measurement scheduling system using requestAnimationFrame and adjusting our approach with fonts.ready and possibly the Marquee onInit callback. 

Currently, the code executes compute in useEffect once, but nodes could have a width of zero if fonts aren't loaded yet or if the marquee applies transforms after mounting. The overlay width calculation might also need an adjustment due to its wrapping inside the Marquee container.
**Identifying Marquee overlay issues**

I'm noticing another problem: our overlay is inside a scrollable container that clones contents for infinite scrolling. It's positioned absolutely relative to its nearest ancestor, which is also scrolling. The challenge is that the overlay only appears after a viewport change, suggesting that the ResizeObserver triggers computation again, while the initial compute might have incorrect values for lefts and rights due to invisibility. 

The querySelectorAll method targets [data-sem-idx] within laneRef div, which is indeed created and entries mapped, but the measurement occurs before children have fully rendered, likely because of font loading. To solve this, I should schedule the compute on the next animation frame a couple of times to ensure accurate measurements.
**Implementing measurement fixes**

I need to make some adjustments by using useLayoutEffect instead of useEffect for measuring, so it runs after the DOM updates but before the paint. I should also call compute when images or fonts loaded, and right now, that’s only focusing on fonts. 

I'll change React.useEffect to useLayoutEffect and schedule measurement using a requestAnimationFrame loop for 2-3 frames. Additionally, I can wait for the document.fonts.ready promise to compute. 

It’s worth checking if Marquee has an onInit callback to recompute, and I might add a key to the wrapper to force re-render after measurement. I'll schedule computations with window.setTimeout and ensure measured.totalWidth reliably sums node widths, including gaps.
**Fixing hook errors**

I’m seeing some errors in the terminal related to hooks. There's an unused YearTick warning, which we could either remove or just leave as is.

The bigger issue is the warning about "React Hook useMemo is called conditionally" at line 310, stemming from boundaryLabelByAfterIndex. It's inside an if (variant === 'marquee') block, which is invalid since it results in conditional hook calls. 

To fix this, I'll need to split the component into two separate components: MarqueeVariant and CollapsibleVariant. This way, the top-level component can render one without calling hooks conditionally. I'll refactor now, moving all hooks to the new components.
**Refactoring components and measurement**

To improve the measurement functionality, I’m placing it inside MarqueeVariant so it runs on mount. First, I need to restructure my TSX file by extracting code from the if (variant === 'marquee') block into a new component, `MarqueeVariant`, and also creating a separate `CollapsibleVariant` for the collapsible case. 

The main `TimelineMarquee` will switch between these components without conditional hooks to preserve proper hook usage. I’ll update the measurement logic to utilize `useLayoutEffect` instead of `useEffect`, and schedule computations using requestAnimationFrame.

As part of this patch, I’ll also remove unused elements like YearTick and console logs, ensuring our layout remains intact and that the design requirements are met while preserving user settings like 'top-10'.</details></think>

- The bars only appearing after a resize indicates initial measurement runs before the lane is fully laid out by the marquee/fonts.

Fixes I applied:
- Split the component into `MarqueeVariant` and `CollapsibleVariant` so hooks aren’t conditional.
- Switched to useLayoutEffect for measurement and scheduled multiple re-measures (requestAnimationFrame x2, timeouts, and `document.fonts.ready`) to ensure correct widths before any resize.
- Removed the console.log and kept higher z-index on the work lane.

Please hard refresh and check again; the work bars should render immediately without resizing.

Have the popup for the course items have a larger z index, and there are two year things on the vertical lines, remove the lower one that is always a year behind 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring Year Ticks and Separators**

In the component, I’m working on rendering year tick markers, with one set positioned absolutely and a label below. The YearSeparator insertion shows components mid-lane. The structure of year tick markers includes a vertical line and a year label at the top, using previous year boundaries. There's a request to remove the lower label that is always a year behind. I need to consider potential duplicates from the YearSeparator and the boundary markers.
**Clarifying Year Markers and Separators**

I think the lower one refers to the "Year tick markers" at the bottom. In the code, these markers are positioned absolutely at the top, defined as "YEAR_TICK_TOP." The YearSeparator inserted between cards adds a mini vertical line with a year label above it. This could be the "lower" one the user mentioned. I need to decide whether to remove the YearSeparator or the static Year tick markers label to avoid confusion over duplicates.
**Identifying the Lower Component**

I think the "lower" component is related to its position in the layout. The Year tick markers are at YEAR_TICK_TOP, which is 60 px below the top of the container. The YearSeparator is inline between cards with a vertical line height that starts just below. It likely shows the "year" text above it. However, the "always a year behind" seems to refer to the Year tick markers that label the previous year. It’s tricky figuring out which one the user considers "lower."
**Clarifying Marker Positions**

It seems the Year tick markers are positioned lower in the layout than the work lane, but still above. The YearSeparator is situated between the cards, so I need to verify their placements. The Year tick markers are at YEAR_TICK_TOP, which I think is 66 px or maybe 60 px below the baseline. The YearSeparator shifts slightly up with -translate-y-2. The user wants the lower component removed, which likely refers to the markers showing the previous year, so I need to consider removing either the markers or the YearSeparator.
**Modifying Year Markers and Z-Index**

The Year tick markers have a vertical line and label, but they overlap with the inline YearSeparator, creating two vertical lines. The user wants to remove the lower one, which I believe is the Year tick markers showing the previous year label. I plan to remove either the label or the entire markers to eliminate duplicates while keeping the YearSeparator for the correct year.

Additionally, I’ll adjust the z-index of the popover and wrapper to z-[1000] and address previous ESLint issues related to key errors. Then I'll make the necessary code modifications to streamline everything.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing user request**

I need to address the user’s request regarding the pop-up for course items and the year labels. The z-index for the popover container is already set to z-[1000]. Now I’m focusing on the second part where the user mentions two year labels on vertical lines. After looking at the code, it seems the "Year tick markers" are displaying a label at the bottom, and the inline YearSeparator is adding another label, likely causing this confusion.
**Clarifying year label issue**

I think the lower year label is the Year tick markers positioned at YEAR_TICK_TOP, which shows the previous year. Meanwhile, the YearSeparator above the line indicates the upcoming year. The measuredBoundaries create a label for the current year, which might appear below since the tick markers display the bottom label. Since the user wants to remove the lower label that's a year behind, it seems we should either remove the text from the tick markers while keeping the vertical line or remove the entire Year tick markers display.
**Deciding on year label adjustments**

The user wants to remove the lower label, which is the measured boundaries label beneath the tick line. I can either remove just the label text and keep the line or remove the entire "Year tick markers" overlay. The YearSeparator should stay since it correctly indicates the next year. I should comment out the label or hide that text while ensuring we keep the vertical lines, but I’m wondering if they mean to remove both the line and label completely.
**Finalizing adjustments for year labels**

I’ll keep the vertical line and the upper label from the YearSeparator, removing the lower label from the markers block. This means I’ll adjust the tick markers to render only the line, omitting the text. I'll also edit out the specific div for the year text. The z-index is already set to be high enough for the pop-over, and while there were lint errors earlier, the user didn't ask to address them. My edits are minor and I’ll apply the patch, ensuring to remove any unnecessary console.log statements.
**Applying final edits**

I need to check the read file. At line 423, we removed the console.log within 'MarqueeVariant', and it’s no longer there. Now, I’ll apply the patch to remove the year label from the tick markers. After making these edits, I'll keep my response minimal and simply say "done." I’ll proceed to execute functions.apply_patch, which will edit the lines in the 'Year tick markers' block. This should wrap things up nicely!</details></think>

- Increased the popup’s z-index:
  - Wrapper now has `z-[1000]`
  - Dialog now has `z-[1000]`
- Removed the duplicate year label:
  - Year tick markers now render only the vertical line; the bottom text label was removed.

Let me know if you want the year label moved above the line instead.

reduce the vertical height of the top lane arnge thing more 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Adjusting layout heights**

I see that we need to reduce the vertical height of the "top lane orange thing," which probably refers to the work lane bars. They want it to be lower, so decreasing the WORK_LANE_HEIGHT (currently 32 px) is a must. The layout involves several parameters, including GAP_BELOW_WORK and BASELINE_TOP. Earlier, we set the container div top to "top-10," but I think it might be better to revert that to "top-0" and focus on shrinking the heights instead.
**Reducing orange lane height**

It seems they want to further reduce the vertical height of the "top lane orange thing." I’m considering lowering it from 32 px to around 22 px, maybe even down to 20 px. I could switch the class from "h-8" to "h-6" (24 px) or "h-5" (20 px), as Tailwind uses "h-5" for 20 px. I’ve got to adjust the WORK_LANE_HEIGHT and possibly the GAP_BELOW_WORK as well. They’re looking for a shorter orange bar, not just reducing the distance to the baseline. I'll aim for a height of 20 or 24 px.
**Finalizing height adjustments**

I'm deciding to go with 24 px (h-6) instead of 20 px for stability, given that we're currently using h-8 consistently. I’ll make sure to update the WORK_LANE_HEIGHT to 24, change the lane container class from "h-8" to "h-6," and do the same for the bar class. The top offset may stay at top-10 since they want a height reduction without altering spacing. This change will affect the baseline and subsequently the year tick top and wrapper padding. Lastly, I’ll apply the necessary patches to the code.
**Updating class references**

I’m looking for all instances of 'h-8' related to the lane, but I need to skip over other uses like in YearSeparator. I’ll check the surrounding lines where the class is defined to ensure I don’t accidentally modify the wrong part. Specifically, I found it in line 434; I’ll change it to h-6. I’ll also update the mapping instances that use h-8 to h-6 and adjust the constant to 24. Time to apply the patch while ensuring everything else remains functional. If needed, I can go to h-5 later.</details></think>

---



---

- Reduced the work lane height from 32px to 24px and adjusted bar classes from h-8 to h-6 for a slimmer look.
- Everything else (padding, labels) stays the same. Want it even thinner or adjust top offset too?

add some margin for when the timeline repeats

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Modifying the timeline marquee**

I need to adjust the TimelineMarquee to create some margin or padding where it loops. The user asked for that specifically. In a react-fast-marquee, content flows seamlessly. To add space between repetitions, I could wrap the content in a container with padding or place an invisible spacer div at the end. However, since the marquee clones its children, it makes sense to add a spacer element at the end equaling the gap width. I should define a `REPEAT_GAP` constant to calculate this.
**Adding spacer for semester cards**

If I add a spacer at the end of the semester cards row, I need to make sure these absolute layers account for the gap width. Otherwise, the overlay elements won't extend into the gap. The user wants some margin when the timeline repeats, likely meaning they want a blank space after the last item before it loops. I think we should only extend the cards row with a spacer, while keeping the overlay lane's width unchanged. I'll define a `REPEAT_GAP` constant, maybe around 64 pixels.
**Implementing trailing spacer**

I need to add a trailing spacer element in the flex row after mapping the semester entries, like this: `<div style={{minWidth: REPEAT_GAP}} />`. While classes can utilize utilities like `w-16`, using a dynamic numeric value is better. The offset change isn't relevant here. It’s essential that the measurement only computes nodes with the `data-sem-idx` attribute, so the spacer won’t affect that. The spacer should sit inside the flex row after mapping, and I’ll add the `REPEAT_GAP` constant, set at 64. I’ll also consider semantics with margin utilities. Lastly, I need to make sure to apply the patch!
**Inserting a spacer in semester row**

I want to create some space around the semester row by adding a spacer. I've already checked the code around line 430. I'll insert a spacer right after the mapping but before closing the row container with `<div aria-hidden className="shrink-0" style={{minWidth: '64px'}} />`. Although I could define a constant, adding it requires more complexity. Instead, I’ll keep it simple with inline styles or compute a constant like `const REPEAT_GAP = 64;`. I’ll ensure I follow lint and hook rules when making these adjustments.
**Keeping it simple**

I think we should focus on minimal changes here, keeping additional text to a minimum. There's no need to alter other widths as that could complicate things. I’ll ensure I apply the patch efficiently to implement the spacer without unnecessary modifications. The goal is to maintain clarity while making the necessary adjustments, so I’m aiming for a clean and straightforward approach. Let’s keep everything streamlined!</details></think>

---



---

- Added a fixed gap at the end of the semester row so the marquee has breathing room before repeating.
  - New constant `REPEAT_GAP = 64` and a trailing spacer div with `minWidth: 64px`.
- Adjust as needed (e.g., 48 or 96) and I can tune it further.
