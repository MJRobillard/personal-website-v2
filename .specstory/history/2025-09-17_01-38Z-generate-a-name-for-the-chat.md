I can see there are compilation errors in your Next.js project. Let me fix these ESLint errors for you.

Now I can see the issues. Let me fix them:

1. In `page.tsx` line 40: There are unescaped apostrophes in the text
2. In `TimelineMarquee.tsx` line 552: The `useMemo` hook is missing the `data` dependency

Perfect! I've fixed both ESLint errors:

1. **Fixed unescaped entities in `page.tsx`**: Replaced the single quotes around 'best' with the HTML entity `&apos;` to properly escape them in JSX.

2. **Fixed missing dependency in `TimelineMarquee.tsx`**: Added `data` to the dependency array of the `useMemo` hook to satisfy the `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` rule.

The compilation errors should now be resolved. Your Next.js project should compile successfully without any ESLint errors.
