# Adjust card layout for mobile view (2025-09-17 01:20Z)

_**User (2025-09-17 00:47Z)**_

 the what I'm working on now portion on mboile, the line goes straight through the card components. Change it to on the left side only on mobile

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you fix the timeline line issue on mobile. Let me first examine the current TimelineMarquee component to understand how the line is currently positioned.


---

Read file: undefined

---

Now I can see the issue. Looking at the code, I can see that the timeline line is created by the baseline element on line 434-437. The line spans the full width of the timeline and goes through all the cards. On mobile, you want this line to only appear on the left side of the cards.

Let me examine the current structure more closely and then make the necessary changes:

                />
```

</details>

Perfect! I've updated the timeline line to only appear on the left side on mobile devices. Here's what I changed:

**The fix:**
- **Mobile (default)**: `bg-gradient-to-r from-foreground/50 via-foreground/50 to-transparent` - This creates a line that starts solid on the left and fades to transparent on the right
- **Desktop (md and up)**: `md:bg-gradient-to-r md:from-transparent md:via-foreground/50 md:to-transparent` - This maintains the original centered line behavior on larger screens

This change ensures that:
1. On mobile devices, the timeline line only appears on the left side of the cards and fades out as it goes right
2. On desktop/tablet (md breakpoint and above), the line maintains its original centered appearance
3. The line still serves its visual purpose of connecting the timeline elements while not interfering with the card content on mobile

The line will now fade out as it approaches the card components on mobile, creating a cleaner visual hierarchy while maintaining the timeline's structural purpose.

The have the z index of those cards higher 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll increase the z-index of the semester cards to ensure they appear above the timeline line. Let me update the z-index for the cards container:

Perfect! I've increased the z-index of the semester cards container from `z-10` to `z-20`. This ensures that:

1. **Semester cards** now have `z-20` - highest priority
2. **Work lane** has `z-20` (already set) - same level as cards
3. **Timeline line** has `z-0` - lowest priority, will appear behind the cards
4. **Year tick markers** have `z-0` - also behind the cards

This layering ensures that the cards will always appear on top of the timeline line, preventing any visual interference while maintaining the proper visual hierarchy of the timeline elements.

I mean this timeline. The line should be on the left side on mobile only: Academic & Work Timeline

_**Assistant**_

I see! You're referring to a different timeline section - the one that shows "Academic & Work Timeline" with the current projects. Let me search for this specific timeline component to understand its structure.

Now I can see the timeline section in the main page. Let me look at the TimelineSectionItem component to understand how the timeline line is structured:

Perfect! I've successfully updated the timeline line styling for the "Academic & Work Timeline" section. Here's what I changed:

**For Mobile (max-width: 767px):**
- **Position**: Moved the line from center (`left: 50%`) to the left side (`left: 0`)
- **Transform**: Removed the centering transform (`transform: none`)
- **Width**: Made it slightly thinner (2px instead of 3px) for better mobile appearance
- **Opacity**: Slightly reduced opacity (0.8) for a more subtle look on mobile

**For Desktop:**
- Maintains the original centered timeline line behavior

**Both Light and Dark Modes:**
- Applied the same mobile positioning logic to both themes
- Dark mode uses the neon lapiz color while light mode uses the gradient

Now on mobile devices, the timeline line will appear only on the left side of the timeline items, creating a cleaner visual hierarchy that doesn't interfere with the card content while still providing the structural timeline connection.

_**User (2025-09-17 00:47Z)**_

Also move the corresponding dot with it, its in the middle right now

---

_**Assistant**_

I need to move the timeline dots to align with the left-side timeline line on mobile. Let me check the current CSS for the timeline nodes and update it:


---



---

Now I need to add mobile-specific positioning for the timeline nodes. Let me add the mobile styles:

Perfect! I've added mobile-specific positioning for the timeline nodes. Here's what the change does:

**For Mobile (max-width: 767px):**
- **Position**: Moves the dots from the center (`left: 50%`) to align with the left-side timeline line (`left: 0`)
- **Transform**: Adjusts the positioning to `translateX(-50%) translateY(-50%)` to center the dot on the left edge
- **Important**: Uses `!important` to override the inline styles from the component

**For Desktop:**
- Maintains the original centered positioning

Now on mobile devices, both the timeline line and the corresponding dots will be positioned on the left side, creating a consistent and clean visual alignment. The dots will be perfectly aligned with the left-side timeline line, maintaining the visual connection between timeline items while keeping the content area clear.

And move the corresponding text that goes above it like fall 2025

---

_**Assistant**_

I need to move the year text (like "Summer 2025 -") to align with the left-side timeline on mobile. Let me check the current CSS for the year text and update it:


---



---

I can see the year text is styled with `left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2` which centers it. I need to add mobile-specific CSS to move it to the left side. Let me add the mobile styles for the year text:

Perfect! I've added mobile-specific positioning for the year text. Here's what the change does:

**For Mobile (max-width: 767px):**
- **Position**: Moves the year text from center (`left: 1/2`) to the left side (`left: 0`)
- **Transform**: Changes from `translateX(-50%)` (centering) to `translateX(0)` (no horizontal offset) and maintains the vertical positioning with `translateY(-2rem)`
- **Targeting**: Uses `.timeline-item .absolute.left-1\/2` to specifically target the year text elements

**For Desktop:**
- Maintains the original centered positioning

Now on mobile devices, all three timeline elements will be aligned on the left side:
1. **Timeline line** - positioned on the left edge
2. **Timeline dots** - centered on the left edge of the line
3. **Year text** - positioned above the dots on the left side

This creates a clean, consistent left-aligned timeline on mobile while preserving the centered design on desktop.

_**User (2025-09-17 00:47Z)**_

Have it stack the text cause of overflow for that dot

---

_**Assistant**_

I need to adjust the year text positioning to prevent overflow when it's positioned on the left side. Let me modify the CSS to stack the text vertically and ensure it doesn't overflow:

+     overflow: hidden;
+     text-overflow: ellipsis;
    }
  }
```

</details>

---

Perfect! I've added overflow handling for the year text on mobile. Here's what the changes do:

**For Mobile (max-width: 767px):**
- **White-space**: `nowrap` prevents text from wrapping to multiple lines
- **Max-width**: `80px` limits the width to prevent overflow beyond the timeline area
- **Overflow**: `hidden` clips any text that exceeds the max-width
- **Text-overflow**: `ellipsis` adds "..." when text is truncated

This ensures that:
1. The year text stays on a single line
2. It doesn't overflow into the content area
3. Long text gets truncated with ellipsis for a clean appearance
4. The text remains positioned above the timeline dot on the left side

Now the timeline will have a clean, contained appearance on mobile with proper text handling that prevents any overflow issues.

_**User (2025-09-17 00:47Z)**_

Meh remove the dot completely on mobile and that corresponding text

Perfect! I've simplified the mobile timeline by hiding both the dots and year text. Now on mobile:

**Hidden Elements:**
- **Timeline dots** - completely hidden with `display: none !important`
- **Year text** - completely hidden with `display: none !important`

**What Remains:**
- **Timeline line** - positioned on the left side
- **Timeline content cards** - clean layout without visual clutter

This creates a much cleaner mobile experience with just the left-side timeline line providing the visual structure, while the content cards have more space and a less cluttered appearance. The timeline still maintains its structural purpose but with a minimal, clean design on mobile devices.
